# Things to Do for the Project in the Future

Howdy! This is a list, in no particular order, of things that should be done to this project in the future:

- Proper JS framework implementation
- Tailwind or other CSS implementation
- Printer page should just be redone altogether
- SSO (Single Sign-On) for the site sign-on
- A proper URL so we can send pictures using the room check form
- Proper user verification
- Use a better salt
- More easter eggs
- Real-time updates (this would come with a JS framework implementation)
- Customizable user profiles
- Better search functionality
- Lazy loading (lowkey, I've almost crippled the network a few times)
- Better analytics and a graph maker tool for the data
- Better site tooltips
- User notifications about things to be done
- Honestly just like redo the whole thing its not my best work :\
